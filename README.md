## CS-370 TreasureHuntGame
# Tools Used
This project used the Keras and tensorflow libraries to implement the reinforcement learning to solve the pathfinding problem.
#AI
The setup code for the game, including GameExperience.py and TreasureMaze.py, was provided to me. I created the code that implements the reinforcement learning algorithm and game loop from stubbed out code. As a computer scientist, I tackle complex problems with a technical mindset and make use of available resources and current technology knowledge to solve them efficiently. An important ethical concern that I have learned in this course pertains to hidden bias in AI. It is possible for any AI system to contain biases that could negatively impact our society without our knowledge. As a machine learning developer, it is crucial for me to be aware of my own biases and strive to design systems that are not inherently biased.
